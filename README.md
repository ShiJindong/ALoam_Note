# ALoam_Note
Chinese Note when I learned ALoam
---
A-LOAM is an Advanced implementation of LOAM (J. Zhang and S. Singh. LOAM: Lidar Odometry and Mapping in Real-time), which uses Eigen and Ceres Solver to simplify code structure.  see: https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/A-LOAM

This is Note that I used when I learned A-Loam. 
I took the Reference from:
